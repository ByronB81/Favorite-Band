        <ul>
          <li>Scott - "The Dreamy One"</li>
          <li>Jason - "Probably Someones Name"</li>

        <h2>Why not indeed!</h2>
        <p>I never loved you. It must be wonderful. Bender, we're trying our best. Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! Oh, I think we should just stay friends. Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence.</p>
        <ol>
          <ls>I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!</ls>
          <ls>Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family.</ls>
          <ls>Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most.</ls>
        </ol>
        <h2>Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love!</h2>
        <p>I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him! It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Why would I want to know that?</li>
          <li>Say what?</li>
          <li>Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it.</li>

    <p>Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. Also Zoidberg. And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it.</p>
    <p>Why did you bring us here? Say it in Russian! I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! And I'm his friend Jesus. Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money!</p>
    <p>When will that be? There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! They're like sex, except I'm having them! Leela's gonna kill me. For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs!</p>
    <p>I love you, buddy! And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.</p>
    <p>It must be wonderful. Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope?</p>
    <p>Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. What kind of a father would I be if I said no? Okay, I like a challenge.</p>
    <p>Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say. A true inspiration for the children. Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you!</p>
    <p>No! Don't jump! Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. Actually, that's still true. Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?</p>
